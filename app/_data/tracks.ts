      'NAMI Yolo is an organization that provides free mental health support and resources in Yolo County. It is primarily led by families, friends and individuals whose lives have been affected by mental illness. The organization heavily relies on trained volunteers to deliver educational programs, lead support groups, assist with events, and give community presentations. However, there is no unified system to track the entire volunteer process—from recruitment and onboarding to training, scheduling, and tracking volunteer hours. Additionally, it is important to track which courses each volunteer is trained to teach to ensure proper program delivery.  Currently, NAMI Yolo uses Google Drive and spreadsheets, which makes managing volunteer engagement and program coordination inefficient and time-consuming. To enhance organization and communication, NAMI Yolo seeks to implement a centralized volunteer management system that provides an intuitive interface for tracking volunteer activity, training history, and scheduling. How can we upgrade NAMI Yolo’s current system to create a streamlined and effective volunteer management system?',

However, the organization does not have a centralized and efficient digital tool to track these services for each client, alongside their demographic data (e.g., ethnicity, language, age, gender), and outcomes over time. To enhance service coordination and data management, Fourth & Hope seeks to implement a secure and user-friendly digital intake and service-tracking system. This system should log daily service usage, track client demographics and progress, generate custom reports (e.g., number of showers given by age group), and help identify areas where additional support is needed.
